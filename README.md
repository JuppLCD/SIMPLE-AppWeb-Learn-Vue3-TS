# Simple AppWeb to learn Vue 3 with Typescript

Web application was created in Vue 3 in order to learn this framework. This was my first app created in vue 3, so it's a very simple app. It consumes a Breaking Bad api to obtain data from the characters of the series and paint it on the screen, also, I included a bit of vue router to handle different views.
